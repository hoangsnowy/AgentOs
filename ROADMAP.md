## 1 — Vision & positioning

**AgentOS is a desktop-native, multi-tenant operating shell for AI software-engineering agents.**
Most agent frameworks are Python libraries you wire together in code. AgentOS is a running
*product*: a Blazor desktop environment on a .NET 10 backend that coordinates a team of
role-specialized agents — Orchestrator, Requirement, Coding, Testing, QA — across the software
development lifecycle, with a provider-agnostic LLM gateway, enterprise identity, per-tenant
governance, and evidence/audit built in.

### Competitive positioning

| Product | Form factor | Language | Focus | Multi-tenant / on-prem | Where AgentOS differs |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) (Microsoft) | Python library | Python | General multi-agent conversation | No (library) | AgentOS is a deployed product with UI + identity, not a lib you assemble |
| [MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT) | Python framework | Python | "Software company" role agents | No | MetaGPT ends at code-gen scripts; AgentOS adds tenancy, audit, governance, UI shell |
| [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) | Python framework | Python | Role/crew orchestration | Partial (Enterprise SaaS) | .NET-native, on-prem-first, SDLC-specialized vs generic crews |
| [Devin](https://www.cognition.ai/) (Cognition) | Hosted SaaS | Closed | Autonomous SWE agent | Cloud only, closed | AgentOS is open, self-hostable, inspectable; Devin is a black box |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) | IDE (VS Code fork) | Closed | In-editor coding assist | No (per-dev) | Cursor = single-dev IDE; AgentOS = team/tenant SDLC platform |

**The gap AgentOS fills:** every popular framework is either (a) a Python library where you're the
integrator, or (b) a closed SaaS. Nobody offers a **.NET-native, desktop-shell, multi-tenant,
on-prem-ready SDLC agent platform with governance and evidence built in.** That's a defensible niche
for organisations that (1) live in the Microsoft/.NET stack, (2) can't ship code to a third-party
cloud (finance, gov, healthcare), and (3) want to *govern and measure* agent output, not trust it blindly.

### Target personas

1. **Enterprise dev team** in a .NET shop — wants agent assistance but code can't leave the building. On-prem + Keycloak/Entra SSO is the unlock.
2. **Software consultancy** — many client projects, needs hard tenant isolation so client A never sees client B's code or prompts. Multi-tenant is the unlock.
3. **Internal platform / DevEx team** — wants to offer "agents as a service" to its own engineers with audit, cost control, and RBAC. Open-core + observability is the unlock.

---

## 2 — Where it is today

AgentOS is a working platform, not a sketch. Already shipped:

- **One engine, three surfaces** — Pipeline (sandbox story), Workflow (visual graph of the same 5
  agents, [#52](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/52)), and Spine (real ticket →
  PR) all run the same engine. Spine tickets run either the **Quality** brain (full 5-agent pipeline
  with a greenfield router) or the **Quick** brain, with a user-facing toggle, cost label, and
  bidirectional cross-links between all three apps
  ([#54](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/54),
  [#73](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/73)).
- **5-agent SDLC pipeline** (Orchestrator/Requirement/Coding/Testing/QA) in a **Leader–Specialists–Quality loop** that iterates to convergence or an iteration cap.
- **Provider-agnostic LLM gateway** — Claude + Azure OpenAI via `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` `IChatClient`, plus Microsoft Agent Framework and a paired dev-machine **RemoteAgent** (zero server API tokens). Multi-key pool with 429 failover; cost calculation; per-tenant BYO LLM keys ([#71](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/71)).
- **Safety baseline** — budget gate on every server-token entrypoint, per-tenant rate + concurrency
  limits, `runner_shell` output cap ([#55](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/55));
  fail-closed tool-policy gates, tenant-filter freeze, and SSRF guard
  ([#72](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/72)).
- **Modular monolith** — each feature is a self-contained `IModule` with its own DI surface, EF Core context, and Postgres schema; any module can later ship as a standalone package.
- **Multi-tenant identity** — Keycloak OIDC (RS256) or operator mode (HS256), tenant claim, **row-level isolation** via an EF global query filter.
- **Governance & evidence** — every tool call flows through `IToolGateway` → per-tenant `IToolPolicy` → `IToolInvocationLog`.
- **Cloud hardening (in code)** — ForwardedHeaders behind TLS-terminating ingress, durable
  Postgres-backed DataProtection key ring, publish-mode environment gating, `RequireDatabase`
  fail-loud, Keycloak custom image + postprovision hook groundwork
  ([#69](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/69),
  [#70](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/70)).
- **Tools & MCP** — GitHub PR service, build verifier, an MCP client (consume external tool servers), and AgentOS's own pipeline served as MCP tools.
- **Remote repo execution** — Workspaces + Sessions drive boards → tickets → AI coding sessions against connected repos.
- **Plugin system** — runtime-discovered `IAgentOsPlugin` extensions dropped into a `plugins/` folder, no compile-time reference.
- **Supply-chain + SAST** — Dependabot, dependency-review, SHA-pinned actions, least-privilege workflow tokens, CodeQL at 0 findings ([#56](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/56), [#62](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/62)–[#65](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/65)).
- **Health probes** — `/health` + `/alive` mapped unconditionally for container orchestrators ([#58](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/58)).

### Honesty ledger

Status vocabulary used throughout this document: **Shipped+verified** (exercised in a running
deployment), **Shipped, cloud-unverified** (in code and tested, but no real cloud round-trip yet),
**Planned**.

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| Cloud hardening (ForwardedHeaders, DataProtection, env gating) | Shipped, **cloud-unverified** — no real `azd up` round-trip yet |
| Multi-tenant isolation | Shipped+verified at row level; B4 residue now closed in code — run-history tenant stamping (run + metric rows), `AuthSession` null-`HttpContext` fail-open, `OrchestrationStore` per-tenant keying ([#72](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/72)); full-stack two-tenant E2E pending the `azd up` round-trip |
| `build_verifier` execution | **Not sandboxed** — runs MSBuild on LLM-influenced code in-process ([audit #10](docs/deploy-readiness-audit.md)); gated **off by default in Production** ([#72](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/72)) until the Q1 sandbox lands |
| Scale-out (≥2 replicas) | **Unverified** — single-instance only until a 2-replica test (see Q2) |

## 3 — The 12-month roadmap

Sequencing is dependency-driven with one hard external commitment in the **Sep–Dec 2026** window.
The spine: **identity decision → `azd up` round-trip → tenant residue + secrets → demo hardening →
enterprise ops → OSS launch**. The `build_verifier` sandbox is a parallel Q1 track — it does not
depend on the Azure deployment. PR-level slicing for the E/F/G workstreams lives in
[coherence-plan.md](coherence-plan.md), the engineering appendix to this roadmap.

### Q1 (Jun–Aug 2026) — Live on Azure

- **Goal:** a clean `azd up` produces a working, secured AgentOS on Azure Container Apps — login,
  run, persist — with no seeded credentials and no in-process RCE.
- **Deliverables:**
  - **Identity ([D1](#4--open-architecture-decisions), decide month 1):** persistent Keycloak on
    managed Postgres per [docs/keycloak-prod-runbook.md](docs/keycloak-prod-runbook.md) —
    `KC_DB=postgres`, stable `KC_HOSTNAME`, `KC_PROXY=edge`, theme baked into the image, seed users
    stripped, secrets via `azd env` / Key Vault.
  - **Real `azd up` round-trip:** provision → configure → redeploy → smoke test — OIDC login on the
    real FQDN, an authenticated pipeline run that persists under the real tenant, realm + saved LLM
    keys surviving a restart. Fix the dead `/auth/token` CD smoke step.
  - **Sandboxed `build_verifier`, done properly ([audit #10](docs/deploy-readiness-audit.md)):**
    ADR for the sandbox architecture ([D2](#4--open-architecture-decisions)) in month 1;
    implementation months 2–3 — ephemeral per-build container, no egress, CPU/mem/disk/timeout
    quotas, always-synthesized project file (model-authored `.csproj`/`.targets`/`.props` rejected),
    `--no-restore` with a locked feed.
  - **Multi-tenant residue (audit B4) — ✅ closed in code:** run-history repo tenant stamping (run +
    metric rows) and `AuthSession` null-`HttpContext` fail-open are fixed; the
    [#72](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/72) `OrchestrationStore` per-tenant keying ships;
    only the full-stack two-tenant verification on the real cloud deployment remains.
  - **Secrets, first slice (F2) — ✅ shipped:** the dead HS256 secret + operator password are gone from
    `appsettings.json` (`DevSecretGuard` fails fast on any committed dev default); production secrets
    flow through azd Key-Vault-backed secret parameters (`AddParameter(secret: true)`).
  - **Low-severity security — ✅ shipped:** explicit workspace-connect `Host` allowlist
    (`Workspaces:AllowedHosts` / `WorkspaceHostPolicy`, defense in depth on top of the
    [#72](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/72) connect-time `SsrfGuard`, gating connect +
    add-repo + the find-boards/repos probes); ownership check so a member cannot revoke another
    member's runner/session.
- **Exit criteria:** a documented `azd up` from a clean environment yields a deployment where an
  external user can log in via OIDC and complete a pipeline run that persists under their tenant;
  a malicious-`.csproj` fixture test proves the sandbox cannot reach the host or the network; zero
  default credentials anywhere in the deployed environment.
- **Deferred:** real SMTP ([D4](#4--open-architecture-decisions): realm `verifyEmail:false` for
  now), scale-out, observability backend, Entra/Okta SSO, repo-grounded Quality editing.

### Q2 (Sep–Nov 2026) — Defensible demo ⭐ hard deadline anchor

> External commitment lands in the Sep–Dec 2026 window. Everything in Q1 plus this milestone is the
> minimum defensible set; Q3/Q4 content can slip without breaking the commitment.

- **Goal:** the live deployment survives a hostile end-to-end demo and hard questions about
  architecture, cost, and isolation.
- **Deliverables:**
  - **Latency/UX:** LLM token streaming (`GetStreamingResponseAsync`) + prompt-keyed HybridCache
    (E5); per-shell-command streaming in session runs; "Find boards" picker.
  - **Operability:** deploy-time migrations with an advisory lock (E1); observability backend wired
    (App Insights / OTLP exporter) so a demo run is visible as traces + cost telemetry.
  - **Scale-out honesty resolved:** run the 2-replica test; then either ship the backplane choice
    ([D3](#4--open-architecture-decisions)) or pin sticky sessions + `minReplicas=1` and *document*
    single-instance as the supported posture.
  - **Secrets, second slice (F2):** finish the `IRuntimeOverrides` reshape into an async secret
    provider — async key getters shipped in [#72](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/72);
    retire the remaining sync bridge (unblocks Q3 secret rotation).
  - **Gateway robustness:** pooled-client wrapper leak, failover gaps (401/400/5xx), CostCalculator
    unknown-model `$0`.
  - **Defense-grade docs:** `docs/architecture.md` refresh; ADRs 0001–0005 (modular monolith, LLM
    gateway, multi-tenant isolation, one-engine-three-surfaces, sandbox);
    `docs/FEATURE-MATRIX.md` — every module/app tagged Working / Degraded-standalone / Stub / Gap.
- **Exit criteria:** a scripted 15-minute demo on the live Azure deployment — login → board ticket →
  Quality run with streaming progress → PR on a real repo → cost + trace shown in the observability
  backend — executed by someone other than the author; FEATURE-MATRIX published with no "Working"
  claim that isn't verified.
- **Deferred:** RBAC depth, audit export, DR drill, marketplace, local models.

### Q3 (Dec 2026 – Feb 2027) — Enterprise-grade operations

- **Goal:** every table-stakes enterprise concern is either shipped or has a recorded decision —
  silence reads as "forgotten".
- **Deliverables:** RBAC depth (admin / developer / viewer roles gating budget + tool-policy admin
  actions); audit export + tamper-evident trail from `IToolInvocationLog` + Tenants audit; data
  retention / GDPR-style deletion (or an explicit recorded deferral); backup/restore + an *executed*
  DR drill with timings; SLO definitions + alert rules on the existing OTel metrics (budget
  over-cap, runner disconnect, failed run); secret rotation for tenant PATs + LLM keys (built on
  Q2's async secret provider); real SMTP (closes [D4](#4--open-architecture-decisions));
  `docs/operations.md` + `docs/governance.md` written against the hardened state.
- **Exit criteria:** all six enterprise rows shipped-or-decided; an alert fires on a real over-cap
  run; a restore drill from backup is documented with timings.
- **Deferred:** schema-per-tenant / infra-per-tenant isolation tiers, SOC 2 certification itself
  (readiness checklist only), Okta SSO.

### Q4 (Mar–May 2027) — Open the doors: OSS launch & extensibility

- **Goal:** a stranger can adopt, run, and extend AgentOS without talking to the author.
- **Deliverables:** authoring guides (module / agent / plugin / tool / LLM provider);
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` rewritten as a 5–10-minute first-PR path; community skills pack
  (module-scaffold, tool-scaffold, lint-conventions + CI check); plugin contract polish +
  first-party sample plugins; engineering write-ups (why .NET agents, multi-tenant isolation, the
  sandbox story); launch push (README, screenshots, runnable examples).
- **Exit criteria:** first non-author issue and first non-author PR merged; a recorded cold-start —
  clean machine → running AgentOS + one custom plugin using only the docs.
- **Deferred:** marketplace, certified packs, hosted AgentOS Cloud.

### Beyond 12 months

No dates — named horizon items: AIOps cost optimization (routing, cheaper-model fallback, measured
against a naive always-biggest-model baseline); prompt-drift regression harness; **local models**
(Ollama, vLLM) for fully air-gapped on-prem; RAG over the tenant's own codebase (pgvector, stays in
Postgres); event-sourced runs → replay + time-travel debugging; agent/prompt-pack marketplace with
quality gating; tiered isolation (row → schema → infra) as a pricing axis.

### Milestone map (old → new)

| Old milestone | Where it went |
|---|---|
| M1 — OSS polish | Q4 |
| M2 — Extensibility depth | Q4 + beyond |
| M3 — Enterprise-ready | split: Q1 (deploy + secrets) / Q3 (RBAC, audit, DR) / beyond (Okta, SOC 2) |
| M4 — Observability + AIOps | Q2 (backend + traces) + beyond (AIOps) |
| M5 — Ecosystem | beyond |

## 4 — Open architecture decisions

Decision log — recommended defaults, not prescriptions. Each gets decided (and recorded as an ADR
where marked) by its deadline; until then the roadmap assumes the default.

| ID | Decision | Options | Recommended default | Decide by | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Identity provider in cloud | Persistent Keycloak-on-Postgres vs Entra External ID | **Persistent Keycloak** — [the runbook exists](docs/keycloak-prod-runbook.md), preserves Tenants-module admin provisioning + custom theme + on-prem parity; Entra would force a Graph rewrite and weaken the on-prem story | Q1 month 1 | everything in Q1 |
| **D2** | `build_verifier` sandbox host | ACA Jobs vs Docker-in-ACA (likely dead end — privileged containers unsupported) vs ACI per-exec container groups vs process-level jail (insufficient alone) | **ACA Jobs** with egress disabled + CPU/mem/timeout quotas; local dev runs the same image via Docker under Aspire; project-synthesis + locked-feed defenses apply regardless of host | Q1 month 1 (ADR-0005) | Q1 sandbox implementation |
| **D3** | Blazor Server scale-out | Azure SignalR backplane vs ACA sticky sessions + `minReplicas=1` | **Sticky sessions + min 1 replica** through the deadline window; adopt Azure SignalR only when the 2-replica test proves a real need | Q2 | E2; honest scale claims |
| **D4** | Email | Defer (`verifyEmail:false`) vs ACS Email / SendGrid now | **Defer in Q1**, wire real SMTP in Q3 | Q1 (defer) / Q3 (wire) | signup verification, invitations |
| **D5** | Web↔API topology | Web in-process (today's reality) vs Web→API over HTTP (the API container is currently deployed but never called by Web) | **In-process for the deadline**; record the split as the scale path; stop deploying the unused API container or wire it — don't ship dead topology | Q2 | RemoteAgent hub reachability in cloud |

## 5 — Technical pillars

Long-term architecture commitments — where we are → where we go.

- **Orchestration** — *Now:* 5 agents in `AgentOs.Modules.Pipeline`, executed as a sandbox story (Pipeline), a visual graph (Workflow `GraphExecutor`), or a real ticket (Spine) with two brains — Quality (5-agent) and Quick — behind one toggle. *Next:* user-defined agents via plugins; richer graph routing (conditional, parallel fan-out); no lock-in in the orchestration layer (our contracts, MAF/SK as one engine, not the only one).
- **LLM abstraction** — *Now:* Claude + Azure OpenAI + MAF + RemoteAgent behind `ILlmClient`/`ILlmClientFactory`, per-tenant BYO keys. *Next:* token streaming + response cache (Q2); **local models** (Ollama, vLLM) for fully air-gapped on-prem; capability negotiation (tool-calling/vision/context window) so the router picks per task. Rule: **always ≥2 providers wired.**
- **State** — *Now:* per-module Postgres contexts (modular monolith). *Next:* event-sourced agent runs → replay + time-travel debugging; snapshot a run, branch it, re-run with a different prompt/model (doubles as the prompt-drift regression harness).
- **Observability** — *Now:* OTel wired (spans + metrics) but no backend; structured logs drive `cost-report`. *Next:* exporter to App Insights / OTLP (Q2); OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions; cost telemetry as a first-class signal, not a log scrape.
- **Security** — *Now:* Keycloak OIDC, JWT, tenant row-level isolation, per-tenant rate limit + budget gate + `runner_shell` cap, fail-closed tool-policy gates, SSRF guard, CodeQL SAST at 0. *Next:* **sandboxed code execution** — ADR + ephemeral quota'd container scheduled Q1 (see [D2](#4--open-architecture-decisions)); then zero-trust between modules, prompt-injection defense, and output filtering (PII/secrets).
- **Multi-tenant** — *Now:* row-level isolation via tenant context + isolation tests. *Next:* tiered isolation — row-level → schema-per-tenant → isolated infra per tenant; sell isolation level as a pricing axis.
- **Knowledge** — *Now:* agents are stateless beyond prompt context. *Next:* RAG over the tenant's own codebase + docs (pgvector, stays in Postgres); citation tracking so a claim links back to a source line.
- **Tools** — *Now:* MCP client + server, GitHub PR service, build verifier, `runner_shell`. *Next:* broader MCP tool catalog, browser automation for agents that verify a running app, richer native API calls.
- **UI** — *Now:* Blazor desktop shell, interactive circuits. *Next:* SSR + interactive islands for faster first paint; a mobile read-only view (check a run from your phone); a **CLI** for CI/headless use — same backend, no browser.

## 6 — Business model

| Model | Free | Paid | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|------|------|
| **OSS-first** (sponsor) | Everything | Goodwill | Max adoption | Revenue weak/unpredictable for a small team |
| **Open core** | Core agents, single-tenant, basic auth | SSO, fine-grained RBAC, audit/compliance, schema/infra isolation, support | Adoption *and* a clear paid line | Must police the core/enterprise boundary |
| **SaaS** | Trial | Hosted seats | Recurring revenue | On-prem buyers (the whole point) can't use it |
| **Consulting** | The OSS | Time | Immediate cash + user insight | Doesn't scale |

**Recommendation — open core.** The target personas (on-prem .NET enterprises, consultancies)
*cannot* use SaaS — keeping code in-house is exactly why they'd pick AgentOS, which rules out pure
SaaS as the primary model. The features enterprises pay for (SSO/Entra, fine-grained RBAC,
audit/SOC 2, infra-level isolation, priority support) are precisely the ones that should be gated —
and they're the Q3-and-beyond roadmap. Start OSS for adoption, introduce the enterprise edition when
those features land. Consulting fills the gap and feeds requirements. A hosted "AgentOS Cloud" stays
a *later optional* offering, not the core bet.

## 7 — Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **LLM cost explosion** | A runaway loop burns the budget in hours | ✅ per-tenant/per-run budget gate + rate limit (shipped); cheaper-model routing (beyond-12mo); prompt-keyed cache (Q2) |
| **Agent loop / hallucination** | Confidently wrong code, infinite loops | ✅ QA gate + max-iteration cap (shipped); human-in-the-loop checkpoints; a quality benchmark in CI |
| **Multi-tenant data leak** | Tenant A sees tenant B → trust dead, legal exposure | ✅ row-level isolation + fail-closed gates + tenant-filter freeze (shipped); B4 residue scheduled Q1; audit the tenant context on every data-access PR; tiered isolation for high-assurance tenants |
| **Sandbox escape** | Agent-run code touches the host | ADR-0005 + ephemeral quota'd sandbox **scheduled Q1**; interim mitigation: `build_verifier` gated **off by default in Production** + fail-closed tool-policy gates ([#72](https://github.com/hoangsnowy/AgentOs/pull/72)) |
| **Hard external deadline (Sep–Dec 2026)** | A slipped milestone breaks an external commitment | Q1+Q2 scope is the minimum defensible set; Q3/Q4 content is explicitly off the critical path and can slip without breaking the commitment |
| **Prompt drift** | Yesterday's good prompt silently regresses | Version prompts v1→vN; snapshot fixtures; regression test in CI (`prompt-tune` scores variants) |
| **Vendor lock-in** | A provider changes pricing/API | ✅ `IChatClient` abstraction + ≥2 providers wired; add a local model (Ollama/vLLM) as the always-available floor |
| **Prompt injection** | Malicious input hijacks an agent | Strict template boundaries (untrusted input never concatenated into the system prompt); input/output classification; secret/PII output filter |

---

## 8 — Definition of success

- **Near term (the Q2 anchor)** — AgentOS live on Azure, demoed end-to-end by someone other than the
  author: login → ticket → streaming Quality run → real PR → cost + trace in the observability
  backend.
- **Mid term** — the enterprise checklist green (RBAC, audit export, DR drill, rotation); first
  external contributors (non-author issues + a merged non-author PR).
- **Long term** — pick the lane the data points to: a thriving open-core/community project (companies
  in production, sustainable contributors) **or** a commercial lane (enterprise seats + hosted
  AgentOS Cloud). Instrument adoption months in; let the numbers choose rather than pre-committing.
