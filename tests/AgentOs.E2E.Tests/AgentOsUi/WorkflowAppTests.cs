// AgentOS UI — the Workflow studio actually RUNS the drawn graph end-to-end in the browser. Same gate +
// fixture as the other desktop UI tests (RUN_AGENTOS_E2E=true, Web at AGENTOS_URL). The standalone Web has
// no LLM key, so the run rides the Offline failover provider (Llm:OfflineFallback) — proving the run-path
// works keyless. This is the coverage the audit found missing: every prior Workflow E2E only opened the
// window; these drive Run → live node status → completion, including the new control-flow + Human nodes.
//
// Window interactions are scoped to ".appwin.focused" (the WindowManagerService singleton stacks windows
// across runs), matching SpineAppTests. Blazor Server can drop a click that lands before the freshly-opened
// window's circuit is interactive, so the Run click is retried until the Run-Log panel confirms it took.
