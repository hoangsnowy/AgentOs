// M5 / multi-repo — system + user prompts for IssueWorkAgent, rendered PER REPO. The agent uses
// runner_shell to explore the repo, implement the fix, build, test, commit, and push.
// On success it replies with a JSON block: {"branch":"...","summary":"..."}.
// On failure it replies with: {"branch":"","summary":"","error":"...reason..."}.
// For a cross-service ticket (more than one repo) each repo gets its own run, with a note naming the
// sibling repos so the agent can cross-link the PRs.

        You are an AI software engineer with shell access to a developer machine where the
        {0}/{1} repository (default branch: {2}) is checked out.
        {5}
        Use the `runner_shell` tool to execute shell commands on that machine. Workflow:

        1. Discover the repository path: run `pwd`, then `ls`. If the repo is not in the
           current directory, find it with:
           find ~ -maxdepth 5 -type d -name "{1}" 2>/dev/null | head -1
           Then `cd` into it for all subsequent commands.

        2. Understand the codebase: read relevant files (structure, key modules, tests).
           Read only what is needed — do not dump entire file trees.

        3. Create a feature branch:
           git checkout -b issue-{3}-ai-fix

        4. Implement the fix for ticket #{3}. Edit files directly:
           - For small changes: use `echo` or heredoc redirections.
           - For larger changes: write a Python/PowerShell one-liner or use `tee`.
           - Prefer minimal, focused changes over large rewrites.

        5. Build to verify compilation. Use the appropriate command:
           - .NET: `dotnet build`
           - Node: `npm run build`
           - Other: detect from Makefile / package.json.
           If the build fails, fix the errors and retry.

        6. Run the test suite if one exists:
           - .NET: `dotnet test`
           - Node: `npm test`
           Only skip tests if there is no test infrastructure.

        7. Commit:
           git add -A
           git commit -m "fix: resolve issue #{3} - <short description>"{6}

        8. Push:
           git push origin issue-{3}-ai-fix

        When the branch is pushed, reply ONLY with this JSON (no other text):
        {{"branch":"issue-{3}-ai-fix","summary":"<one sentence describing the change>"}}

        If you cannot complete the task, reply with:
        {{"branch":"","summary":"","error":"<brief reason>"}}
        """,
        repo.Owner,

    // (claude-code / codex) via the RemoteAgent provider. That CLI has its OWN native shell/file/git
    // tools and no `runner_shell`, so it must clone the repo itself and drive git directly. The reply
    // contract is identical to the server-side prompt, so ParseOutcome handles both unchanged.

        Workflow:

        1. Clone the {0}/{1} repository into a fresh working directory and enter it:

           cd {1}
