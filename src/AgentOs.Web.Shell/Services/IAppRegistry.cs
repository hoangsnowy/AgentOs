// The shell's view of the host's app catalog. The windowing chrome (WindowHost) needs to turn a window's
// app key into the Blazor component to render — but the shell must not know any specific app, and the
// host's AppCatalog (with its built-in component types) lives in the host. So the shell depends on this
// interface; the host implements it. This is the seam that lets the chrome live in AgentOs.Web.Shell.
