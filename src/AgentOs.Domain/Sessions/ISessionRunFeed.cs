// M6 — live session-run event feed. An in-memory, per-tenant pub/sub the desktop subscribes to so a
// running session's progress (dispatch → per-repo lifecycle → done/failed) surfaces live, replacing the
// old fixed-interval status poll. Best-effort by design: events are a UX nicety, NOT the source of
// truth — the session repository remains authoritative, so a dropped event or a subscriber that joined
// mid-run is reconciled by the next DB read (the desktop refreshes on every terminal event + a slow
// backstop poll). Pure BCL, so the contract lives in Domain next to the rest of the session model.
