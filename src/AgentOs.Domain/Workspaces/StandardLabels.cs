// Bootstrap — the standard label taxonomy AgentOS stamps on a board's repos so generated tickets are
// classified consistently. Four axes: type (what kind of work), area (which layer), priority, and the
// ai gate (ai:ready = AgentOS may auto-run it; needs-human = it must not). Lives in Domain so the
// Web can seed it and the Pipeline decomposer (slice 2) can constrain itself to these names — both
// reference Domain only. Colors are GitHub 6-hex without a leading '#'.
